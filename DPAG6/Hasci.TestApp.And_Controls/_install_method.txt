The installation of the HASCI TestApp and Controls is done using ScanNgo 
barcodes or by using a SDcard

The _S2L dir has all files neccessary for a remote install

_Network connection_

If you dont use an open WLAN with SSID "INTERMEC", you have to configure the WLAN
connection of the target devices. This can be done manually or by another ScanNgo
barcode, for example see ScanNGo_WLAN_INTERMEC.pdf.

_IDL installation_

the IDL has to be installed first. I have done a download xml for ScanNgo for IDL only:
hasci_idl.xml. The IDL will be downloaded and the install will be started automatically.

To create a ScanNgo barcode for the IDL install, open SmartSystems Console and then select 
Tools and "Start ScanNgo".

In Step 1 check only "Software Download Location or SmartSystems Folder". Click NEXT.

In the field "Load Software from URL" enter the network location of 
hasci_dpag.xml, for example "ftp://192.168.128.5/s2l/dpag/hasci_idl.xml". Click NEXT.
[if you need to change the server address of the files, you have to change all 
references inside hasci_idl.xml too!]

Enter a note withon the Notes field, check PDF417 barcode type and select 
"No Start Barcode" and "No Reboot".

Print the barcode. Optionally save the barcode print page as PDF for later use. 
Click CLOSE.

Just scan the created ScanNgo barcode and watch the magic.

If the install will not start automatically, you can scan the barcode inside 
idlpkg_install.tif. This will start updatebin with the downloaded idl package.

_App installation_

To create a ScanNgo barcode, open SmartSystems Console and then select 
Tools and "Start ScanNgo".

In Step 1 check only "Software Download Location or SmartSystems Folder". Click NEXT.

In the field "Load Software from URL" enter the network location of 
hasci_dpag.xml, for example "ftp://192.168.128.5/s2l/dpag/hasci_dpag.xml". Click NEXT.
[if you need to change the server address of the files, you have to change all 
references inside hasci_dpag.xml too!]

Enter a note withon the Notes field, check PDF417 barcode type and select 
"No Start Barcode" and "No Reboot".

Print the barcode. Optionally save the barcode print page as PDF for later use. 
Click CLOSE.

Just scan the created ScanNgo barcode and watch the magic. The device may boot several
times and finally the app is installed.

_Flash File Store/ActiveSync installation method_

#manual install

You can use sync_from_S2L_to _setup.bat to sync the files to the setup dir. Then you can
manually copy the files below setup dir to the right dirs on a device.

You have to tap/install \flash file store\CAB\IDL.cab.pkg on the device FIRST.

#ActiveSync install

Then you can use sync_idl_install.bat with an ActiveSync connected device to start
the install of the IDL.

Use sync_to_FFS.bat to sync the files to FFS of device using an ActiveSync connection and 
start a cleanboot install.
